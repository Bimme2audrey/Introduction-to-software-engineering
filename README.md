1)Yes it is, because software engineers apply engineering principles to create software, therefore software engineers take part in system developtment by connecting clients need with technological solutions. They systematically develop processes to provide specific functions by using engineering concepts to develop software. 

2)Software crisis is a term used for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. Which is due to the rapid increase in computer power and the complexity of the problem that could be tackled.

3)He develops Information systematically. By designing, developing and installing software solutions 
He determines operational feasibility by evaluating analysis,problem definition, requirements, solution developtment and propose solutions. 

4)True, Due to using engineering concepts to develop software, they produce more reliable system at a faster rate.
